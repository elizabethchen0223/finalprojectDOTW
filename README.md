# My greenHOUSE
<!-- Title: maybe less related to quarantine? change name?? -->

<!-- Introduction -->
The theme of our project is to convey the feeling of “stuckness” during the quarantine, but not necessarily in an inherently negative or positive light.  The greenhouse is to plants what our homes are to us. In a way, the plants are quarantined for the same purpose that humans are: to protect us from the harsh environmental conditions outside our doors. The current quarantine crisis can be looked at in a way of social isolation, a required condition that spurs on feelings of anxiety, fear, and loneliness. However, a deeper look into the condition of the quarantine can show insight into a journey of physical, mental, and spiritual improvement. We hope to invoke a sense of “stillness” during this time of struggle for anyone going through any issue. 

<!-- home page layout has changed -->
The homepage will show a map-like layout of a garden made with SVGs, and 3 individual SVG icons will point to the three other drawings in this project. This interface will serve as a map indicated by different infrastructure, activities in a greenhouse garden that allows the users to transport themselves as if on a virtual tour of a greenhouse garden. 

<!-- first drawing -->
The first drawing will show a plant's emotional state between day and night. When user hovers over the plant, it shows its sentimental nature, symbolizing a person's mental health. This drawing emphasizes the importance of constantly checking in with yourself on how you feel and it is okay to not be okay. This is especially important during this special period where we may need connections from others more than ever. This drawing is meant to symbolize feelings that people may have when they are alone. This drawing will be implemented using SVG elements animated by CSS or javascript DOM animation.

<!-- second drawing -->
The second drawing will show the potential of growth in humans, we will be using a speed up time physical growth of a potted plant from the time the seed is planted to full growth. The goal of the image is to evoke a sense of inevitable growth as we are forced to reflect on our own well being. The process growth automatically occurs through JavaScript DOM animation. The focus is entirely on this one plant, and the environment around this one plant will show a more stagnant look at the environment. 

<!-- third drawing -->
For our third drawing, we are inspired by some of the popular activty people do during qurantine, which is gaming. When the user clicked on the button, a plant on the Nintendo Switch screen will start its growth. We are trying to reference to people's growth through this time of lockdown, whether virtually or in real life, as people will always find ways to grow.

<!-- Conclusion -->
All of our drawings revolve around the sense of growth, uncertainty, and nourishment. We hope that in viewing our web pages, the user gets a sense of the universality of emotions that circulate around social isolation, but also reflect on their mental and spiritual well being during this time of introspection.
