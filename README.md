# Quarantined Greenhouse

The theme of our project is to convey the feeling of “stuckness” during the quarantine, but not necessarily in an inherently negative or positive light.  The greenhouse is to plants what our homes are to us. In a way, the plants are quarantined for the same purpose that humans are: to protect us from the harsh environmental conditions outside our doors. The current quarantine crisis can be looked at in a way of social isolation, a required condition that spurs on feelings of anxiety, fear, and loneliness. However, a deeper look into the condition of the quarantine can show insight into a journey of physical, mental, and spiritual improvement. We hope to invoke a sense of “stillness” during this time of struggle for anyone going through any issue. The homepage will show the outside of a greenhouse, made either through vector or raster graphics, and host the navigational interface page that will connect with the three other pages. This interface will essentially be a control panel with the buttons indicated by different plants, that allows the user to transport themselves as if in a virtual tour of a greenhouse. The first drawing will show a plant log that document's a plant's health since it arrived at the greenhouse, symbolizing a person's mental health from the start of quarantine. The plant log will document the plant’s state through svg plant drawings and its need for water/sun, its soil quality, etc. This reflects a person’s state during the quarantine, including the frustrations, the difficulties and the need that may arise during this time. This drawing will be implemented using CSS animation and javascript to let the user interact with the animation by scrolling through the page.
The second drawing will show the potential of growth in humans, we will be using a speed up time physical growth of a potted plant from the time the seed is planted to full growth. The goal of the image is to evoke a sense of inevitable growth as we are forced to reflect on our own well being. The process growth automatically occurs through JavaScript DOM animation. The focus is entirely on this one plant, and the environment around this one plant will show a more stagnant look at the environment. For our third drawing, we will attempt to give the user a sense of tranquility. A glimpse/representation of nature within our current unnatural situation. Using CSS animation and Javascript DOM animation, we will manipulate vector graphics of a bonsai tree and allow the user to “trim” and nurture the bonsai tree with their clicks. We hope the sense of duty and ownership of the bonsai will give the user a sense of calmness during this state of chaos and uncertainty. This is our neutral drawing of the final project. All of our drawings revolve around the sense of growth, uncertainty, and nourishment. We hope that in viewing our web pages, the user gets a sense of the universality of emotions that circulate around social isolation, but also reflect on their mental and spiritual well being during this time of introspection.
